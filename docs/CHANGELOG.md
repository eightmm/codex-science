# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added a second skill source: Google DeepMind `science-skills` (38 skills), vendored under `vendor/gdm-science-skills/` at commit `0b42509` with preserved LICENSE, SKILL_LICENSES.md, and PROVENANCE.md.
- Generalized the catalog to multiple sources via `catalog/sources.json`; inventory schema bumped to 2 with per-skill `source` and per-source commit metadata (loader stays backward-compatible with schema 1).
- Source-prefixed every wrapper name (`kdense-*`, `gdm-*`) to keep provenance clear and avoid cross-source collisions; catalog now holds 187 wrappers.
- Added a source-level default license so skills without a per-skill license inherit their repository license (DeepMind: Apache-2.0); descriptions sanitize angle brackets for Codex validation.
- Simplified installation: `bootstrap.sh` is now a light installer (Python check + shallow submodule) and no longer requires `uv`; fixed a hardcoded validator path in `doctor.sh`/`check.sh` that broke setup on non-author machines.
- Refreshed README with a banner and an install/usage/license focus.
